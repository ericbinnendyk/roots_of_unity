# roots_of_unity
Software to calculate expressions for roots of unity using radicals.

There are two versions: refined\_nth\_roots.py, which uses the newer "refined" method of calculation and nth\_roots.py, which uses an older method. Also included is a paper describing the theory behind the algorithm (roots-of-unity.pdf) and a module containing functions for calculating the length of expressions (expr\_metrics.py).
